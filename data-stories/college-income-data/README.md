# Overview

The point of our analyses was to investigate whether or not different properties of colleges change based on location of the school. We chose to focus on the factors of racial diversity and median student income after graduation. Considering the large number of schools included in this dataset, we decided to cluster data by state. We created bar plots to show demographic data and median income across the states. Finally, we plotted demographics vs average median income. 

# Dataset

We started by using the college income data that was already uploaded on Jupyter. However, this data set did not include enough information about each school’s location. We found another data set from the same source as our original data (College Scorecard Data), that had the original data plus location information (latitude, longitude, state, zipcode). 

# Running the code

The code should be run by running the code from top to bottom. The code could be changed to run similar analyses on different data sets. 

# Contributing to the code

One could investigate the relationship between average state demographic composition and average median income over time, as the dataset provides income statistics at different time points after graduation. It would also be possible to conduct a more holistic analysis of graduates’ economic standing by incorporating the dataset’s information about debt. One could also run these analyses on data about high schools across the country. This would require uploading a new data set and changing several lines of code to match the name of the data set before running the code.
