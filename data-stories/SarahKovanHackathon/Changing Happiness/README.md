# Contributing

Because countries with the lowest happiness scores were more subject to changes in their happiness scores over the two year period, it is possible that conditions in those countries are unstable. Those hoping to contribute to this notebook should consider looking into major events or changes (e.g. war, recessions, political changes, etc.)that occured in the most variable countries betwen 2015 and 2017.
