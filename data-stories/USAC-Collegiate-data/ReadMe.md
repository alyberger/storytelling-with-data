# USA Climbing Collegiate Series Observations
by Matt Rube


## Overview
This data comes from USA Climbing and includes membership information for its youth and collegiate series. The collegiate series is a rapidly growing arm of the sport and is facing new challenges in the coming seasons. USA Climbing officials would benefit enormously from having a better understanding of how membership in the league may continue to grow in the next couple of years. Competition formats and rules, as well as membership pricing and competition costs, can all change or remain the same depending on the predicted rate of growth of membership in the league. 

The data is visualized in bar graphs to show that membership in the league has been steadily increasing over the past 9 seasons, along with the number of college climbing teams in the United States. This indicates that the sport is spreading to new colleges and new opportunities are opening for incoming college students to find teams and compete. 

My analysis also plotted collegiate membership on a map of the US to show how different regions in the US have greater or fewer collegiate members. Since future seasons may see the USAC realigning the regions of the collegiate series, visualizing the geographic spread of membership may be helpful. I also plotted the regional memberships of the youth league alongside the collegiate data to show how the size and location of youth regions can correlate with the size and location of collegiate regions . There seem to be some patterns between the overlapping areas, but there is too little data to fully parse through a potential correlation between the geographic distribution of the leagues. 

## The data
The data was pulled from the USA Climbing website and aggregated to exclude competitor information. Other data came from records of USA Climbing on collegiate membership and team growth over the past nine seasons.

## Running
To run the notebook, simply go from top to bottom. 

## Future
There are a couple of potential future analysis that can be run on this data. For one, it would be interesting to compare by number and visually the growth rate of the youth competitive league over the same time period as the collegiate league, and also to the first nine seasons of the youth league (to see if collegiate has seen similar growth in its first nine seasons). It would also be interesting to run a regression on the two data sets to see if youth growth is predictive of collegiate growth.
