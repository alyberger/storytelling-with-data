# Overview

This notebook analyzes various family-related variables that may influence happiness scores. The notebook was inspired by the previous finding that family is one of the most influential factors in countries' reported happiness scores.

Of the factors analyzed in this notebook, household size appears to be the family-related variable that has the strongest relationship with happiness score. Further analysis of household size indicates that it is also correlated with GDP PPP and unmet family planning needs, two variables that are also correlated with happiness score.

# Dataset

The dataset is composed of countries' happiness scores (taken from https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness), and information about household size and composition, divorce rates, paid parental leave, family planning, domestic violence, and gender roles taken from (http://www.oecd.org/els/family/database.htm and https://data.worldbank.org/).
